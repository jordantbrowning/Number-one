			<p>From National Geographic: The playful North American river otter is equally at home in the water and on land. It makes its home in a burrow near the water's edge, and can thrive in river, lake, swamp, or estuary ecosystems. Otter abodes feature numerous tunnelsâ€”one of which usually allows them to come and go from the water.</p>
